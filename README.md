# lurching-towards-dragon
An immensely incomplete Pascal-lite compiler front-end.

Uses lex & yacc (scanner & parser) along with simple syntax tree
and symbol table ("stack" of "hash tables") written in unoptimized C.

Caveat: memory leaks abound, documentation minimal at best.
Intended to be used as a starter kit.
